Javascript
-------------
->It  is a programming language that allows us to implement complex feaute of the web pages.
->HTML-it is a markup language that we use to structure and giving meaning to our web content.
->CSS-it is a language of style rules that used to apply styling to our Html Content.
->Javascript-It is scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content.
->Syntax Parser:it is a program that reads your code and findout your code is valid or not.
->Lexical Envirenment:Where something sits physically in the code you write.
ex:f1unction(){
    anklmdjdj1
    kmondkmld1
    cedeklmnd
}
->Execution Context:
  A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
  lexical 1
  lexical 2
  lexical 3
  for e.g There are lots of lexical Envirenment which one is currently running is managed by Execution context.
  Name/Value pairs
  -----------------
  A name which maps to a unique value(name:'santanu')
  ->Object:
   A collectin of these value pare is called object.
   ->what is global Envirenment and Global object?
   Ans:When ever code is running inside Javascript it runs inside an Execution context..
   ->Javascript Execution engine creating two things for us.
   (1)Global Object
   (2)This
   ->why we are using console.log?
   ans:it is the one which will help you to write to your output to your console window.
  Hoisting:
  -----------
  When we declair variable and function in Javascript the exection engine sets up a memory space for variable and function .
  if it a variable i will assign default value is called undefined and if it is a function i will copy the entire function.
  and keep in the memory.
  Ex:b();
  console.log(a)
  var a="hello world"
  function b(){
      console.log("called b")
  }
  output:called b
         undefined

undefined:
it is special value in javascript.

Difference between (==,===):
------------------------------
->==:Check for value(a=10)
->===:check for value and type
ex:var a="10"
   console.log(a===10)
   output:false
->==if a is 10 or not checking if a is a number or string
=>===if a is 10 and a is an integer
